2. 9 commits found using "git log origin/master"

3. README.md was last modified 2021-10-13 20:08:27 -0400
   used git command "git log -1 --pretty="format:%ci" README.md"

4. easily merge versions at a later date, isolate code from others work

5. git log shows commits, history and filter the logs
   status is to inspect the working directory and see what changes are waiting to be commited

6. git log --raw shows all the commits made and descriptions and Vehicle.h can be searched for
   git log --Vehcile.h shows all the commits to Vehicle.h file

7. to find the word file use the git command "git log -S file"

8. Inheritance is when a new data type is defined as an extension of a previous data type
   Polymorphism is the ability to have a method work for differenct objects. At run time the system
   chooses which method will be used for the object.
   Encapsulation is containing the methods and data hidden inside the class but providing getters and
   setters for public access

9. The main difference would be 2 repositories per developer and a single integration manager for the integration workflow

10. The lieutenant repo merges the changes required
